## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  I would like to develop an app that users can calculate the cost of their commute to work with. Users would be able to look up the location of their work place and where they are communting from as well as the cost of gas in their area. I would hopefully also have the option to entire the price of gas for a more exact calculation. Users could project the cost of their communte over a certain amount of time, i.e. weekly or monthly. Users could also log how much thier commute is costing based on actual gas purchases. 
  Users could use this app to help in decisions to take a job due to cost of a commute. Users could also use this app to help with budgeting or help with reduciing their carbon foot print. I thought of this idea becuase of the need for budgeting the cost of gas and though it would be nice to have an easier way to calculate this cost. 
### Features
This app would have a login feature so that individual info could be stored. It would have a search/map feature to locate the work place location as well as the starting location for the communte. It would also have a feature for looking up the average cost of gas in your area or from a specicific gas station. It would have a feature where is displayed the cost of the users commute based on their selected length of time (per day, per week, per month). It would also have a feature where it it dispalyed a log of the users actual commute cost based on entered gas purchases.
### Technologies
The technologies this app would use are Spring Boot, Bootstrap, MySQL, IntelliJ, Gradle, Crudrepo

### What I'll Have to Learn
I would like to use an API to create the gas price look up freature as well as the map/distance look up feature.
